1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main overview with statistics and charts
2. **Tasks** (`/tasks`) - Task management with checkbox controls and priority badges
3. **Habits** (`/habits`) - Interactive habit tracking with progress indicators
4. **Time Tracking** (`/time-tracking`) - Activity logging with time summaries
5. **Notes** (`/notes`) - Note-taking and journaling interface
6. **Goals** (`/goals`) - Goal setting and progress tracking

Use the hamburger menu (â˜°) in the top-left corner to access the sidebar navigation and switch between sections.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Angular CLI 20 (optional, but recommended)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rickzzyy/daily-tracker-web.git
   cd daily-tracker-web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## API Integration

### Environment Configuration

Update the API URL in the environment files:

**Development** (`src/environments/environment.ts`):
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api', // Your local API server
  appName: 'Daily Tracker'
};
```

**Production** (`src/environments/environment.prod.ts`):
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://your-api-domain.com/api', // Your production API
  appName: 'Daily Tracker'
};
```

### Expected API Endpoints

The frontend expects the following REST API endpoints:

```
GET    /api/dashboard/stats     # Dashboard statistics
GET    /api/tasks              # List tasks
POST   /api/tasks              # Create task
PUT    /api/tasks/:id          # Update task
DELETE /api/tasks/:id          # Delete task

GET    /api/habits             # List habits
POST   /api/habits             # Create habit
PUT    /api/habits/:id         # Update habit
DELETE /api/habits/:id         # Delete habit

GET    /api/habit-entries      # List habit entries
POST   /api/habit-entries      # Create habit entry
PUT    /api/habit-entries/:id  # Update habit entry
DELETE /api/habit-entries/:id  # Delete habit entry

DELETE /api/goals/:id          # Delete goal
```

### Mock Data

Currently, the application uses comprehensive mock data for demonstration purposes. Each component includes realistic sample data:

- **Time Tracking**: 10+ time entries spanning multiple days with diverse categories (work, learning, exercise, personal)
- **Goals**: 6 sample goals with varying progress levels and categories (learning, career, health, personal)
- **Habits**: 4 interactive habits with progress tracking and different units (sessions, minutes, glasses)
- **Notes**: 6 detailed notes with various tags and content types (ideas, learning notes, reflections)
- **Tasks**: Sample tasks with different priorities and completion states

To connect to a real API:

1. Ensure your API server is running
2. Update the environment configuration with the correct API URL
3. Uncomment the actual API calls in the service methods
4. Remove or comment out the mock data sections

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build for development
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linting

## Development

### Adding New Components

1. Generate a new component:
   ```bash
   ng generate component components/feature-name
   ```

2. Add the component to the routing in `app.routes.ts`

3. Import required PrimeNG modules in the component

### Styling Guidelines

- **PrimeNG Theming**: Use PrimeNG's built-in CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Component Structure**: Follow the established pattern with container, header, and grid/content sections
- **Responsive Design**: Utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts that work on all screen sizes
- **Card-based Layout**: Use PrimeNG Card components for consistent visual hierarchy
- **Color Consistency**: Use PrimeNG's severity classes and CSS custom properties for consistent styling
- **Interactive Elements**: Implement hover effects and smooth transitions for better user experience
- **Progress Indicators**: Use visual progress bars and circles to show completion status
- **Spacing**: Maintain consistent padding and margins using CSS custom properties

### Component Architecture

- **Standalone Components**: All new components use Angular's standalone architecture
- **Modular Imports**: Import only necessary PrimeNG modules to keep bundle size optimized
- **Reactive Updates**: Use Angular's reactive patterns for real-time UI updates
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define clear data models for type safety and better development experience

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
